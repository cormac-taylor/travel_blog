          <h3>Pack Smart with a Capsule Wardrobe</h3>
          <p>
            Packing light can save you time, stress, and money on checked
            baggage fees. Create a capsule wardrobe with versatile,
            neutral-colored clothing that can mix and match easily. Choose
            layers, quick-dry fabrics, and a few statement accessories to keep
            your outfits fresh. This way, you’ll always be prepared without
            carrying unnecessary items.

          <h3>Keep Digital and Physical Copies of Important Documents</h3>
          <p>
            Always keep digital and physical copies of essential documents like
            your passport, ID, travel insurance, and itinerary. Store digital
            copies in a secure cloud storage service, like Google Drive or
            Dropbox, so they’re accessible anywhere. Having copies ensures you
            won’t be left stranded if anything goes missing.

          <h3>Use Google Maps Offline</h3>
          <p>
            Download maps of your destination in advance using Google Maps’
            offline feature. This trick is a lifesaver, especially if you’re
            traveling somewhere with spotty internet or data coverage. Just
            download the map for your area and use GPS without data – it’s
            perfect for finding your way around without relying on Wi-Fi.

          <h3>Learn Basic Local Phrases</h3>
          <p>
            Knowing even a few essential words or phrases in the local language
            (like “hello,” “please,” “thank you,” and “help”) can make a huge
            difference. Locals appreciate the effort, and it often opens doors
            to more authentic interactions and better service.

          <h3>Bring a Portable Charger and Adapter</h3>
          <p>
            A portable charger is essential for keeping your devices powered,
            especially during long days of sightseeing or travel. Additionally,
            a universal travel adapter is handy for international trips, as you
            never know what plug type you’ll encounter. Look for a compact,
            all-in-one adapter that covers multiple countries.
